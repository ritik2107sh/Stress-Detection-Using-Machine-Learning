# Stress-Detection-Using-Machine-Learning
Stress-Lysis data might be unsuitable for classification such as decision tree and random forest to discover insightful suggestions. Decision tree suggests that high stress people's temperature is higher than 91.905°F and low one is lower than 84.005°F. Decision tree and random forest are both accurate when classifing Stress-Lysis data.
